# Mjolnir Window Hints Module

Provides a fancy method of window switching for [Mjolnir](http://mjolnir.io).
Pressing a shortcut brings up "hints" which are app icons with a letter,
typing that letter focuses the corresponding window.

Currently it is in a very hacky state, it works for me but is not packaged
for use by others.

Hints are centered on the window they will switch to and have a unique key.

Note that the hints still show for hidden windows, this means you can switch
to ANY currently open window in 2 key strokes.

Also note the vertical line of hints in the center, these are all maximized
windows but the hints are spread out so they don't collide.
